    <h2>Hamburger Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get ground chuck and make small round balls with the meat. Flatten the meat into the desired size. Remember, the meat may shrink a bit when cooked.</li>
        <li>Season the meat with desired seasonings, like garlic salt. Heat up pan and cook until the edges start to gray before flipping.</li>
        <li>Keep flipping until both sides are the desired color. I like mine well done, but most people don't.</li>
    </ol>
